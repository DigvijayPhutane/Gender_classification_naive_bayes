# Gender_classification_naive_bayes
"Gender classification using Naive Bayes: A simple and efficient notebook for predicting gender based on textual data."

This project demonstrates the use of three Naive Bayes algorithms (Multinomial, Gaussian, and Bernoulli) for gender classification based on textual data. It's a simple and efficient implementation designed for educational purposes and experimentation.

## Overview

- The Jupyter Notebook 'Gender_classification_naive_bayes.ipynb' contains detailed code and explanations for the three Naive Bayes algorithms.
- The dataset used for this project includes labeled examples of text data for gender classification.

## Contents

- `Gender_classification_naive_bayes.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations for all three Naive Bayes algorithms.
- `gender_classification_v7.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the code and explanations to understand and implement the three Naive Bayes algorithms.
2. You can replace the dataset with your own data for custom classification tasks.
3. Experiment with the algorithms and explore their performance and limitations.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook / colab
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn , matplotlib
